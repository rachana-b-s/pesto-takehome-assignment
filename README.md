## Case Study Requirements:

### Data Ingestion:

Implement a scalable data ingestion system capable of collecting and processing ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data.
Ensure that the ingestion system can handle high data volumes generated in real-time and batch modes.

### Data Processing:

Develop data transformation processes to standardize and enrich the data. Handle data validation, filtering, and deduplication.
Implement logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions to provide meaningful insights.

### Data Storage and Query Performance:

Select an appropriate data storage solution for storing processed data efficiently, enabling fast querying for campaign performance analysis.
Optimize the storage system for analytical queries and aggregations of ad campaign data.

### Error Handling and Monitoring:

Create an error handling and monitoring system to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays.
Implement alerting mechanisms to address data quality issues in real-time, ensuring that discrepancies are resolved promptly to maintain ad campaign effectiveness.
This Ad Tech case study scenario focuses on the challenges and data formats commonly encountered in the digital advertising industry. Candidates can use this information to design a data engineering solution that addresses the specific data processing and analysis needs of AdvertiseX.
